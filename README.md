# OBDIIDiagnosticMonitor
Created by Rory Lange on Feb 9, 2023

This project was an idea that I have had for a while. I wanted to have the gauge view similar to that of a COBB AccessPort without the $700 price tag.
I had the idea to build a device using a raspberry pi 4 that would connect to the OBDII port of my 2017 Ford Focus ST and read values from
the port and display them to the user. 

So far, the project is only partially completed. I have created a simple gui using PyGame in python that displays some simple metrics about the engine.
I have not implemented a way to input the values yet, however, that is the next step. My python development skills are rudementary, however, my experience
with other languages, protocols, api, and microcontrollers allows the information to come to me relatively easily. I am unsure how to move forward with
this project, however, my operating systems class I am taking right now may give me a different perspective on how to implement the code.

This project was used for my programming languages class where I decided to use python to create a gui for my project and display it to the class. In the
near future I will be reading data from the OBDII port to the raspberry pi and be able to display that data on the gui.
